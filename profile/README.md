## The African Research Collective

Welcome to TARESCo (The African Research Collective) 
We're a group of researchers working to improve Natural Language Processing for African languages. 

## What We're Working On

### Making Language Models Work for African Languages

Current AI models often fall short when it comes to African languages. We're studying ways to adapt these models, examining how they handle different language features, and testing methods to improve their understanding. Through experiments and research, we're learning what makes these models work better for our languages.

### Building Better Language Datasets

Good data is the foundation of language technology, but it's often hard to find for African languages. We're exploring different approaches to collect and verify language data, developing tools to identify different dialects, and creating efficient ways to gather high-quality examples. This work helps us understand what makes a dataset useful and representative.

### Learning Together

We believe in the power of shared knowledge. Our community brings together researchers at different stages in their journey - some just starting out, others with years of experience. We learn from each other, exchange ideas, and tackle challenges together. This collaborative approach helps us all grow while advancing the field.

## Join Us!

If you're interested in African languages, technology, or both, we'd love to work with you. You could:

- Work on research projects
- Help gather language data
- Share your knowledge
- Learn from other researchers

## Let's Talk

Have ideas? Questions? Want to work together? Get in touch with us! We're interested in hearing new perspectives and working with others who care about African languages and technology.
